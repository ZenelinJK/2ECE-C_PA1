Disclaimer: Not all in the code is original, most of these explanation come from external sources such as Youtube, Stack Overflow, and my friends who have coded in Python. Thanks to these for helping me with better understanding.

## Alphabet Soup
• Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order.

This program takes the word, phrase or sentence and rearranges all the letters in alphabetical order. Using the function ``alphabet_soup(x)`` with ``(x)`` being the variable. This function will be then called to output the result.
The function uses a ``For loop`` to read each individual letter, and determine it's existing alphabetical value to rearrage them into their places. It also uses a ``.lower()`` so that the capital letters and lower cased letters will 
be read as the same, in it's lower case state.

## Emojis
• Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons.

This program takes specific words and changes them into chat corresponding emoticons, in this case, the words smile, grin, mad and sad changes into different emoticons by using a dictionary to read and replace the words
with its corresponding emoticon. Using the function ``emoticon(emotion)`` in which ``(emotion)`` is a variable. This function will then be returned to output the results. ``.split()`` to separate each word to be able to 
be read by the system and to be replaced by the words in the dictionary, once done, ``.join()`` is used, inside the variable to replace the words is used to combine all the words back into the same sentence string.

## Unpacking List
• Unpack the list writeyourcodehere into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. 

This program takes a pre-existing list and takes these value and puts them in different sets, named first, middle and last. Once entered, there is an packing attribute that reads the values it is looking for. ``*middle`` in this case of
the program is used to locate and pack all values in the middle, and separating it from first and last. Then it is then displayed by First, Middle and Last.
